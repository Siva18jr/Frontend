1) Array Map : The map() method is an iterative method. It calls a provided callbackFn function once for each element in an array and constructs a new array from the results.


2) Array Filter : The filter() method is an iterative method. It calls a provided callbackFn function once for each element in an array, and constructs a new array of all the values for which callbackFn returns a truthy value. Array elements which do not pass the callbackFn test are not included in the new array.


3) Array Find : A function to execute for each element in the array. It should return a truthy value to indicate a matching element has been found, and a falsy value otherwise. 


4) Array FindIndex : The findIndex() method of Array instances returns the index of the first element in an array that satisfies the provided testing function. If no elements satisfy the testing function, -1 is returned.


5) Array Reduce : The reduce() method of Array instances executes a user-supplied "reducer" callback function on each element of the array, in order, passing in the return value from the calculation on the preceding element. The final result of running the reducer across all elements of the array is a single value.
